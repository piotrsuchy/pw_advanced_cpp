# Pac-Man–Style Game Development Checklist

## 1. Setup & Project Initialization

### Decide on Game Framework / Library

- Select environment: Unity, Unreal, SDL, SFML, OpenGL, etc.
- Configure development tools (IDE, build system).

### Create Basic Project Structure

Organize folders/modules for:

- Core game loop / engine code
- Assets (images, sounds)
- Scripts or code for entities (Pac-Man, ghosts)
- UI and menus (if applicable)

### Implement a Game Loop

Tasks:

- Create `GameController` (or main loop class) with `update(float deltaTime)` and `render()` methods.
- Clear the screen, draw something basic (e.g., background or placeholder sprite), and present the frame each cycle.

---

## 2. Input Management

### Implement `InputManager`

Tasks:

- Detect keyboard/joystick events.
- Provide method like `getDirection()` to query direction input.
- Test by logging inputs (up, down, left, right).

### Hook Input to `GameController`

Tasks:

- Call `InputManager.pollInputs()` during the update phase.
- Pass direction commands to a test sprite or player object.

---

## 3. Maze & Level Layout

### Create a Maze or TileMap Class

Tasks:

- Use a 2D array or tile-based system.
- Store data: walls, paths, pellets.
- Provide collision checks like `isWall(TilePosition pos)`.

### Load or Hardcode a Level

Tasks:

- Use a text/JSON file or hardcoded 2D array (e.g., 28×31 grid).
- Implement `loadLevel(int levelNumber)` in `LevelManager`.
- Render maze (walls, floor).

### Place Pellets and Power Pellets

Tasks:

- Mark tiles for pellets / power pellets.
- Render them with sprites (small/large dots).
- Implement `collectPellet(TilePosition pos)`.

---

## 4. Entity System: Pac-Man & Ghosts

### Create Base `Entity` Class

Tasks:

- Fields: position, direction, speed, sprite.
- Methods: `update(float deltaTime)`, `draw()`, `move(direction)`.

### Implement `PacMan` Class

Tasks:

- Extend `Entity`, handle input.
- Check for collisions.
- Track lives.

### Test Pac-Man Movement

Tasks:

- Hook `PacMan.handleInput(input)` to `InputManager`.
- Use `Maze.isWall(pos)` for movement restriction.
- Render position each frame.

### Create `Ghost` Class

Tasks:

- Extend `Entity`.
- Fields: AI state, frightened timer, home corner.
- Method: `updateAI(float deltaTime)`.

### Ghost AI Strategies (Optional)

Tasks:

- Implement different ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, etc.).
- Use `getNextMove()` based on AI state and Pac-Man's position.
- Start with random movement or row/column logic.

---

## 5. Collision & Scoring Systems

### Implement `CollisionManager` (Optional)

Tasks:

- Detect collisions: Pac-Man vs. ghosts, Pac-Man vs. pellets.
- Define outcomes:
  - Normal ghost → lose a life.
  - Frightened ghost → add score, reset ghost.

### Scoring & `ScoreManager`

Tasks:

- `addScore(int points)` for total score.
- Pellet collision → `addScore(10)`.
- Ghost-eating → bonus points.

### Lives & `GameController`

Tasks:

- Decrement lives when caught.
- Trigger game over when lives = 0.

---

## 6. Power Pellets & Edible Ghost Mode

### Extend Collisions

Tasks:

- Detect power pellet consumption.
- Trigger `ghost.enterFrightenedMode()`.

### Frightened Mode Timer

Tasks:

- Add timer per ghost.
- Call `ghost.exitFrightenedMode()` after time expires.

### Ghost Reset After Being Eaten

Tasks:

- Respawn ghost at “ghost house”.
- Optional: delay, animation, or pause before reentering normal mode.

---

## 7. Level Completion & Transitions

### Check All Pellets Eaten

Tasks:

- `LevelManager.checkLevelCompletion()`.
- Move to next level or end game.

### Game Over / Restart

Tasks:

- Show “Game Over” or main menu.
- Optional: prompt for initials for high score.

---

## 8. Menus & UI (Optional / Enhancements)

### Main Menu Screen

Tasks:

- Show “Press Start” or “Play Game”.
- Options for level select or high scores.

### In-Game UI

Tasks:

- Show current score, high score, lives.
- Draw UI in corner or top bar.

### Pause / Resume

Tasks:

- Implement pause state.
- Only update pause menu logic.

---

## 9. Audio & Visual Polish

### Implement `AudioManager`

Tasks:

- Load sounds: wakka, ghost siren, power-up.
- Play sounds on events.

### Animations & Sprites

Tasks:

- Animate Pac-Man (mouth).
- Animate ghosts (legs, frightened color).
- Optional: Pac-Man death animation.

### Bonus Items / Fruit (Optional)

Tasks:

- Occasionally spawn fruit.
- Award bonus points on collection.

---

## 10. Testing & Tuning

### Test Collisions Extensively

Tasks:

- Check edge cases (same tile, tile boundaries).

### Adjust Speeds & Difficulty

Tasks:

- Tune Pac-Man vs. ghost speed.
- Tune frightened mode and timers.

### Playtest for Gameplay Feel

Tasks:

- Ensure gameplay is fair and fun.
- Adjust scoring, lives, and AI.

---

## 11. High Scores / Persistence (Optional)

### Create a Storage System

Tasks:

- Use file-based or DB storage.
- Record top scores.

### Implement `ScoreManager.getHighScore()`

Tasks:

- Load best score at game start.
- Save new high score after game over.

### High-Score Table

Tasks:

- Prompt for initials.
- Show table after game or in menu.

---

## 12. Final Integration & Cleanup

### Consolidate Code & Class Interactions

Tasks:

- Ensure `GameController` orchestrates all components.
- Keep classes single-responsibility.

### Optimize (If Needed)

Tasks:

- Fix performance issues, memory leaks.
- Optimize collision checks.

### Final Build or Deployment

Tasks:

- Package for platform (Windows, Mac, Web, etc.).
- Share or release.
